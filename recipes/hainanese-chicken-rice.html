        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <em>
                Inspired by the famous Hainanese chicken rice, 
                this easy one-pot recipe stands out for its simple approach and delectable flavours. 
                You can make it in a regular pot, an instant pot or a rice cooker.

        </p>

        <p>
            My recipe is inspired by <em>Hainanese chicken rice (海南鸡饭)</em>, 
            a classic dish named after Hainan, the southernmost province of China, 
            but popular in Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            Believed to be invented by Chinese immigrants, 
            this humble-looking yet scrumptious dish consists of four components: 
            A poached whole chicken sliced into pieces,
            rice fried in chicken fat then steamed in chicken stock, scallion, 
            ginger or chilli based sauces and a vegetable garnishing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since it is time-consuming and laborious to make Hainanese chicken rice 
            following traditional methods, we are going to use the one pot method instead. 
            It is simpler to make and the resulting dish is just as tasty and satisfying.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chicken thighs</strong>. I prefer skin-on pieces for their richer flavour. Skinless pieces are fine too.</li>
            <li><strong>White rice</strong>. I usually use jasmine rice. Short grain rice also works.</li>
            <li><strong>Scallions, ginger and garlic</strong>. The classic aromatic trio is used to flavour both the rice and the sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Light soy sauce, lime and sesame oil</strong>. They&lsquo;re used to enhance the taste of the sauce. Add some chopped fresh chilli if you like a little kick of heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Cucumber</strong>. You may also serve other vegetables on the side, e.g. blanched Bok Choy, Gai Lan, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral cooking oil</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Salt and whiter pepper</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Marinate the chicken</strong>. Coat the chicken thighs with salt and white pepper. Leave to marinate for 10 minutes or so.</li>
            <li><strong>Fry the aromatics</strong>. Over medium heat, fry finely chopped scallions, minced ginger and garlic in oil until fragrant. Use a spoon to transfer about ⅔ of the fried aromatics to a small bowl to be used as the sauce.</li>
            <li>Transfer the aromatics and the rice into the rice cooker.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the rice</strong>. Add water following the same rice-to-water ratio you normally use when cooking rice. Place in the chicken and close the lid. Turn on the usual rice cooking program to cook. When it&lsquo;s done, wait for 10 minutes then uncover and serve.</li>
            <li>When it&lsquo;s done, wait for 10 minutes then uncover and serve</li>
            <li>Remove the center bone of the chicken thigh then cut them into bite-sized strips.</li>
            <li>Plate it next to some rice and and sliced cucumbers.</li>
            <li>Stir some light soy sauce, fresh lime juice, a dash of sesame oil and some of the aromatics from earlier to form a sauce. You can drizzle over the chicken or leave to the side.</li>
        </ol>
