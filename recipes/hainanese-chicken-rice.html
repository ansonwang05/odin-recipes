        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <em>
                Inspired by the famous Hainanese chicken rice, 
                this easy one-pot recipe stands out for its simple approach and delectable flavours. 
                You can make it in a regular pot, an instant pot or a rice cooker.

        </p>

        <p>
            My recipe is inspired by <em>Hainanese chicken rice (海南鸡饭)</em>, 
            a classic dish named after Hainan, the southernmost province of China, 
            but popular in Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            Believed to be invented by Chinese immigrants, 
            this humble-looking yet scrumptious dish consists of four components: 
            A poached whole chicken sliced into pieces,
            rice fried in chicken fat then steamed in chicken stock, scallion, 
            ginger or chilli based sauces and a vegetable garnishing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since it is time-consuming and laborious to make Hainanese chicken rice 
            following traditional methods, we are going to use the one pot method instead. 
            It is simpler to make and the resulting dish is just as tasty and satisfying.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chicken thighs</strong>. I prefer skin-on pieces for their richer flavour. Skinless pieces are fine too.</li>
            <li><strong>White rice</strong>. I usually use jasmine rice. Short grain rice also works.</li>
            <li><strong>Scallions, ginger and garlic</strong>. The classic aromatic trio is used to flavour both the rice and the sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Light soy sauce, lime and sesame oil</strong>. They&lsquo;re used to enhance the taste of the sauce. Add some chopped fresh chilli if you like a little kick of heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Cucumber</strong>. You may also serve other vegetables on the side, e.g. blanched Bok Choy, Gai Lan, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral cooking oil</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Salt and whiter pepper</strong></li>
        </ul>
