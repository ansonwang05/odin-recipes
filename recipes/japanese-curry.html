        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <em>Japanese Curry or Curry Rice (Kare Raisu, カレーライス)</em>, is a common comfort food in Japan. 
            It is also one of the most loved home cooked dishes in Japan and many Japanese people grew 
            up eating curry rice as a kid.

            Japanese curry is a curry with a stew-like consistency and commonly has onions, 
            carrots, and potatoes. The sauce is usually thickened by a roux (mixture of fat, flour and spices).
            One can also add some protein or meats to the dish such as chicken, beef or pork.

            This specific recipe will focus on making <em>Japanese Chicken Curry</em> but one
