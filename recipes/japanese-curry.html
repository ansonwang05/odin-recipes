        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Japanese Curry or Curry Rice (Kare Raisu, カレーライス)</strong>, is a common comfort food in Japan. 
            It is also one of the most loved home cooked dishes in Japan and many Japanese people grew 
            up eating curry rice as a kid. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Japanese curry is a curry with a stew-like consistency and commonly has onions, 
            carrots, and potatoes. The sauce is usually thickened by a roux (mixture of fat, flour and spices).
            One can also add some protein or meats to the dish such as chicken, beef or pork.

            This specific recipe will focus on making <strong>Japanese Chicken Curry</strong> but one 
            can feel free to switch out the chicken for beef or pork or nothing at all. 
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 <strong>onions</strong> (large; 1.5 lb, 670 g)</li>
            <li>2 <strong>carrots</strong> (6.7 oz, 190 g)</li>
            <li>3 <strong>Yukon gold potatoes</strong> (15 oz, 432 g)</li>
            <li>1 tsp <strong>ginger</strong> (grated)</li>
            <li>2 cloves <strong>garlic</strong></li>
            <li>1 1/2 lb <strong>boneless, skinless chicken thighs</strong> (can be substituted)</li>
            <li><strong>freshly ground black pepper</strong></li>
            <li>4 cups <strong>chicken stock/broth</strong> or <strong>water only</strong></li>
            <li>1 package of <strong>Japanese curry roux</strong> (7-8 oz or 200-230 g)</li>
            <li>8 servings of <strong>cooked Japanese short-grain rice</strong> or any amount thats enough</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut <strong>2 onions</strong> into wedges or mince or thinly slice them. This depends on personal preference.</li>
            <li>Peel <strong>2 carrots</strong> into rolling wedges so that they have more surface area to absorb more flavor and cook faster.</li>
            <li>Peel <strong>3 Yukon gold potatoes</strong> and cut them into quarters. If you are using russet potatoes cut them into 6 pieces each and add to the pot towards the end of cooking.</li>
            <li>Cut the <strong>1 1/2 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs</strong> into bite-sized pieces and season with <strong>freshly ground black pepper</strong>.</li>
            <li>Heat <strong>1 1/2 Tbsp neutral oil</strong> in a large pot over medium heat and add the onion.</li>
            <li>Sauté the onions, stirring occasionally, until they become translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. If you have extra time, definitely sauté the onions an additional 5 minutes to add more color and flavor.</li>
            <li>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger and mix well together.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until it&lsquo;s no longer pink on the outside. If the onions are getting too brown, reduce the heat to medium low temporarily.</li>
            <li>Add <strong>4 cups chicken stock/broth</strong> or water.</li>
            <li>Add the carrots and Yukon gold potatoes (if you&lsquo;re using russet potatoes, add them later in the last 15-20 minutes of cooking).</li>
            <li>Simmer, <strong>covered</strong>, on medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Simmer uncovered if the ingredients are completely submerged in the broth.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, you can use a fine-mesh strainer to skim the scum and foam from the surface of the broth.</li>
            <li>Continue to cook covered until a wooden skewer goes through the carrots and potatoes.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat. From <strong>1 package of Japanese curry roux</strong>, put 1-2 cubes in a ladleful of cooking liquid. Slowly let it dissolve with a spoon or chopsticks and then stir into the the pot. Can add more cubes based on preference.</li>
            <li>Simmer, <strong>uncovered</strong>, on medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the curry becomes thick, about <strong>5-10 minutes</strong>. If its too thick you can add more water. Make sure that there no roux or food stuck to the bottom of the pot when you stir otherwise it may burn.</li>
            <li>You can now serve the curry with steamed Japanese short-grain rice on the side or with other pairings of your choice.</li>
        </ol>
