        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Japanese ramen eggs, or <em>ajitsuke tamago</em>, are the perfect balance of flavour and texture - rich, 
            soft-boiled yolk enveloped in a savoury soy marinade.
        </p>
        <p>
            They&lsquo;re a signature addition to ramen bowls, 
            but did you know they can also be a snack or a topping for rice dishes?
        </p>
        <p>
            Traditionally served at ramen shops, these eggs are marinated to perfection, 
            taking only a few hours to transform from simple eggs into flavour bombs. 
            They&lsquo;re the little touch that turns a good bowl of ramen into something unforgettable.
