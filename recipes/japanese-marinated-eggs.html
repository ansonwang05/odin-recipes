        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Japanese ramen eggs, or <em>ajitsuke tamago</em>, are the perfect balance of flavour and texture - rich, 
            soft-boiled yolk enveloped in a savoury soy marinade.
        </p>
        <p>
            They&lsquo;re a signature addition to ramen bowls, 
            but did you know they can also be a snack or a topping for rice dishes?
        </p>
        <p>
            Traditionally served at ramen shops, these eggs are marinated to perfection, 
            taking only a few hours to transform from simple eggs into flavour bombs. 
            They&lsquo;re the little touch that turns a good bowl of ramen into something unforgettable.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 large eggs, at room temperature (adjust the quantity based on your needs)</li>
            <li>3 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp dark soy sauce (optional, for a deeper colour)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp mirin (sweet rice wine)</li>
            <li>120 (1/2 cup) water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Boil the eggs</strong>. Bring a pot of water to boil and carefully lower eggs in the pot. Runny yolks should be cooked for 6-7 minutes. Slightly firmer yolks should be cooked for 8-9 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare</strong> an ice bath (a bowl of cold water with ice cubes)</li>
            <li><strong>Immediately</strong> after the eggs are done cooking, transfer the eggs to the ice bath. Let them sit in the ice bath for 5-15 minutes to ensure that they stop cooking.</li>
            <li>While the eggs are in the ice bath we can prepare the marinade. Combine light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, mirin, and water in a small saucepan or container. Heat the marinade gently over low heat until just simmering and remove heat to cool slightly</li>
            <li>After the ice bath peel the eggs and place them in the marinade. Make sure they are completely submerged and refrigerate the marinated eggs for at least 12 hours. They can be kept for up to 3-5 days</li>
            <li>Once ready to serve, remove an egg and slice in half. Enjoy your ramen eggs on top of a steaming bowl of ramen, or simply savour them on their own with some rice.</li>
        </ol>
